An RFID-based payment system integrated with a weight sensing mechanism in  a car parking system enhances automation, security and efficiency. By using RFID technology,vehicles can be identified seamlessly,allowing cashless and contactless entry and exit. The weight sensor determines the vehicle's weight, which can be used for overload detection.
